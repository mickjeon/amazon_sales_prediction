## Abstract
By analyzing the Amazon product dataset, we want to investigate the relationship between discounted prices and regular prices with product success, or the rating received from consumers. Then, we want to build models that predict the optimal discount rate and keyword in product name given a product category and its price. In order to achieve this goal, we plan to explore both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. We plan to use supervised learning to predict the optimal discount rate as the dataset includes numerical value for product success. In addition we plan to use unsupervised learning to learn the optimal keyword in a product name. Through these approaches, we hope to establish a fundamental understanding of machine learning methods and learn each methodsâ€™ strengths and weaknesses through practice.
